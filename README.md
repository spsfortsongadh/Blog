<h2><font color = "brown"><b>‘TEACH A MAN TO FISH’</b>- <i>SCHOOL ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE 2017</i><font/></h2>
The stage couldn’t have been set any better, the much talked-about school enterprise challenge beckoned and 22 students of Singhania Public School jumped into the fray.<br><br>
 The main motive?  To learn the ropes to a successful start-up business and hone entrepreneurial skills…<br>
So, armed with loads of confidence and enthusiasm to take this challenge to its glory, 22 students of Classes IX and X together joined forces under the mentorship of Mr Rushikesh Patil (Sr. Social Science Teacher) and stepped into the ever-fascinating world of commerce and trade.<br><br>

The most viable theme in our set-up had to be one with the best feasibility in terms of resources/raw material and minimal effort from students during their academic hours. Thus it was unanimously agreed to have “My School My Canteen” as a befitting maiden venture .The popular and overwhelming demand of mid-day snacks ensured profits would be steady and sure. Though an experimental venture spanning roughly two months, the enterprise was widely appreciated by staff and students.<br><br>
The ambitious launch required tremendous foresight and was taken up days in advance. Each step had to be carefully planned and executed. The young entrepreneurs set about with the daunting task of providing popular snacks (at a premium) and ensure <i>‘on-time’</i> and <i>‘consistent quality’</i>. Vendors had to be carefully selected, goods had to be procured (based on number of orders, taken in advance), distribution and discipline both had to be of high standards, accounts had to be error-free and most of all- the hygiene of the eatables had to be good. All these fell in place in the first two days of the launch.<br><br> 
The menu was pretty interesting- an eclectic mix of Indo-Chinese cuisine ! Moderately priced and good to taste, the savories were comfort food unto student and teachers alike. The popularity was astounding and garnered positive response , throughout its phase.
In terms of statistics- the table below presents a bird’s eye-view:
  <ul>
<li>TOTAL SALE OF GOODS- 		30,850</li>
<li>COST OF MATERIAL(PURCHASE)-	27,672</li>
<li>NET PROFIT-				3,178</li>
</ul>
<br>The profits are commendable but the lessons learnt by the students involved are enriching and fruitful. Right from meticulous planning to time-bound targets, this enterprise was a great experience. There may have been few pitfalls but all have contributed to something larger than just an experimental exercise. Students are now better equipped with the basics of running a small-scale business, lessons in team-work, handling pressure and of course time-management.<br><br>
With a fervent hope for more such opportunities in the near future, the school looks forward to participating this year and augmenting students’ knowledge by hands-on learning and discover the effective way to entrepreneurship.<br>
